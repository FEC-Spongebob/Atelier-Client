# E-commerce Site

> FEC is a Hack Reactor front-end project that simulates the product page of a typical e-commerce webpage. The user can view the product information, taken from a sample API, and interact with the products styles, images, related products, ratings, reviews, and more.

Given a business document and visual design, we worked as a group of three software engineering students to build out this front-end project.
